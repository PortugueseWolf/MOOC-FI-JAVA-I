# Repeating, Breaking and Remembering

Implement a program that asks the user for numbers (the program first prints "Write numbers: ") until the user gives the number -1. When the user writes -1, the program prints "Thx! Bye!" and ends.
Extend the program so that it prints the sum of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.
Extend the program so that it also prints the number of numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.
Extend the program so that it prints the mean of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.
Extend the program so that it prints the number of even and odd numbers (excluding the -1).
